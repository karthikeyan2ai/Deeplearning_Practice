# Deeplearning_Practice
Deeplearning Practice Logistic regression,DNN,CNN,3D-CNN and GANs

I am sharing my repo of practice notebook on Deep learning algorithms with different hyper-parameter performance comparison.

Dataset used : MNIST ; For 3D-CNN - CIFAR.

GANs Code is Adaption of this github repo : https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN 

I will like to share my code and inferences with different hyperparameter tuning. Feel free to fork the repo and do changes and comment on my inferences of hyperparameter tuning.

Compute Support : Google Colab :)
